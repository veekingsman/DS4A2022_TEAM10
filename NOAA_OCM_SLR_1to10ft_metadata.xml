<abstract>
These data were created as part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Office for Coastal Management's efforts to create an online
mapping viewer depicting potential sea level rise and its associated impacts on the nation's coastal areas. The purpose of the mapping viewer
is to provide coastal managers and scientists with a preliminary look at sea level rise (slr) and coastal flooding impacts. The viewer is a
screening-level tool that uses nationally consistent data sets and analyses.Data and maps provided can be used at several scales to help
gauge trends and prioritize actions for different scenarios. The Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flooding Impacts Viewer may be accessed at:
https://www.coast.noaa.gov/slr

These data depict the potential inundation of coastal areas resulting from a projected 1 to 10 feet rise in sea level above current
Mean Higher High Water (MHHW) conditions. The process used to produce the data can be described as a modified bathtub approach that attempts
to account for both local/regional tidal variability as well as hydrological connectivity. The process uses two source datasets to derive the
final inundation rasters and polygons and accompanying low-lying polygons for each iteration of sea level rise: the Digital Elevation Model (DEM)
of the area and a tidal surface model that represents spatial tidal variability. The tidal model is created using the NOAA National Geodetic
Survey's VDATUM datum transformation software (http://vdatum.noaa.gov) in conjunction with spatial interpolation/extrapolation methods and
represents the MHHW tidal datum in orthometric values (North American Vertical Datum of 1988).

The model used to produce these data does not account for erosion, subsidence, or any future changes in an area's hydrodynamics. It is simply
a method to derive data in order to visualize the potential scale, not exact location, of inundation from sea level rise.
</abstract>
<purpose>
The purpose of these data is to show potential sea level rise inundation ranging from 1 to 10 feet above current Mean Higher High Water (MHHW)
for the area. Although the water surface mapped represents a particular increase in sea level in feet above MHHW, the actual cell values in
the raster dataset represent depth in meters.

These data illustrate the scale of potential flooding, not the exact location, and do not account for erosion, subsidence, or future construction.
Inundation is shown as it would appear during the highest high tides (excludes wind driven tides) with the sea level rise amount. These data should be
used only as a screening-level tool for management decisions. As with all remotely sensed data, all features should be verified with a site visit. The
dataset is provided "as is," without warranty to its performance, merchantable state, or fitness for any particular purpose. The entire risk associated
with the results and performance of this dataset is assumed by the user. This dataset should be used strictly as a planning reference and not for
navigation, permitting, or other legal purposes.

Acknowledgment of the NOAA Office for Coastal Management as a data source would be appreciated in products developed from these data, and such
acknowledgment as is standard for citation and legal practices for data source is expected.

<logic>
Standard methods for determining sea level rise inundation were used. The vertical accuracy of these data is dependent on the source
elevation data and the error associated with vertical datum conversions within NOAA's VDatum software.

The tidal conversion surface of an area serves as one of two source datasets used to create the inundation outputs and is derived from
NOAA National Geodetic Survey's VDATUM software.
</srccontr>
</srcinfo>
<procstep>
<procdesc>
The process to derive the inundation rasters and polygons and low-lying area polygons is as follows:
1. A tidal surface is generated using NOAA VDATUM tool and various spatial interpolation/extrapolation routines, dependent upon the area
being mapped. The surface generated represents the spatial variability of offsets between MHHW, a tidal datum and NAVD88, an orthometric
datum. Each iteration (1-10ft) of slr is added to this base surface and subsequently used for mapping.
2. Using the DEM and the tidal surface (for each iteration of slr), raster calculations are made using ArcGIS Spatial Analyst Raster Calculation
tool to generate multiple rasters, one 32-bit floating point raster representing depth of inundation and one 8-bit single value raster
representing the extent of inundation.
3. The hydrologic connectivity of the single value raster is evaluated using an 8-sided neighborhood rule in ArcGIS using the RegionGroup tool.
The output raster from this process is then converted to a vector polygon feature class for further analysis. Using this 'base' feature class,
a new feature class is created representing hydrologically connected areas. The 'base' feature class is also used to create a feature class
representing unconnected 'low-lying' areas.
